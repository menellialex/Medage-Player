Phase 4- Introduction & Overview Document

Introduction & overview. The introduction document (200 to 400 words) should concisely
indicate changes and additions, if any, of your projectâ€™s specification and design. The overview
file should provide a summary (1 or 2 pages) of your source code, indicating all program units
and modules included in the code. Both introduction and overview files should be submitted in a
zip file that should also contain the entire source code.

Introduction
===================================================================================================
Medage Player was designed with Qt Creator and Qt 6.4. Spotify services were implemented with
Python. The user doesn't add the files to play via drag and drop, but rather a button in the
settings menu to load through the file browser. Due to time constraints, about half of our Level 1
requirements were pushed back, such as the visualizer, AI recommendation system, and Library system.
Medage Player compiles anywhere Qt Creator can compile, given the right libraries are installed. We
currently have stand-alone Windows and Linux executables using windeployqt and linuxdeploy
respectively. The files relating to YouTube Music were early work on implementing YouTube music that
got shelved. The files relating to the PyPlayer was an early implementation of the music-playing
functionality using the Python package PyGame, but was scrapped in favor of the player
implementation in QML.

Overview
===================================================================================================
The source code consists of QML, C++, and python files. QML is an acronym for Qt Modeling Language,
and it is used to model the UI for the system through libraries such as QtQuick and QtControls.
It is also used to implement the functionality of playing music. C++ is the language utilized for
loading the QML files as well as some other modules within Qt. The libraries used within Qt were
QtQuick, QtQuick3D, QtQuickControls, QtMultimedia, and FileIO. The Python packages used in Spotify
integration were spotipy and Spotifycredentials. The spotify files can retrieve images of album
covers as well as plenty of data about the user's spotify account. Specific things that are pulled
are such things like the user's saved playlists, saved albums, and metadata of each song from given
collections.
